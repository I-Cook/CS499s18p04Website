				<p>The AnyWare Chat Bot (AWCB) is an interactive system that aims to ease the process of locating specific items in a warehouse. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)--our customer--has designed a drone that can automatically fill a database with pertinent information for warehouse employees, including the location of specific items as well as their expiration dates. Our project aims to make this data quickly and easily accessible by providing a chat bot interface for warehouse employees; by allowing workers to speak or type their queries to the chat bot, the AWCB aims to make the location of specific materials simpler for employees, thus rendering the operations of the entire warehouse more efficient.</p>
				&nbsp;
				<p>The entire system will be composed of interdependent elements including the website as accessed by the client, the server (where the chat bot will reside), the collection of warehouse databases, and TCS's specially-designed warehouse drones. Our chat bot will be implemented as a responsive web interface that may be used from a computer, tablet, or mobile device. Every warehouse that has a database built by TCS's drones will be able to use the AWCB by simply logging in to their account and typing or speaking their queries. Our bot will (1) take the natural language input from the user, (2) translate their query from natural language into a parseable database query using current approaches in natural language processing and machine learning, (3) access the proper information from their specific warehouse's database, and (4) return the proper information in a pleasing and functional format.</p>

				<p>Our project will require us to implement various features to create a cohesive and effective whole. Our priorities for this project are ordered from greatest to least priority below.</p>
                                &nbsp;
				<ol>
					<li>Chat Bot <br>
						<ul>
							<li>Use machine learning to translate from natural language input to database queries. <br>
								<ul>
									<li>Use some variant of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), since these are the current academic standard for natural language processing (and especially machine translation) tasks.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>If input is speech, translate speech data into text input. <br>
								<ul>
									<li>Customers have recommended that we use a library for this to expedite speech recognition and speech-to-text; we will not have enough data to train our own speech-to-text system, so such a pre-built system will be necessary. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Once database has been queried and information has been received, translate information to a functional and easily readable format. <br>
								<ul>
									<li>Use Adaptive Cards (http://adaptivecards.io/) to produce output that is informative, simple, and pleasing (prioritized in that order). </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>Website Interface <br>
						<ul>
							<li>Will contain all databases for all warehouses.</li>
							<li>Server will house the chat bot and its functionality.</li>
							<li>Specific databases will be accessible by logging in.</li>
							<li>Must be secure. <br>
								<ul>
									<li>Use HTTPS and password hashing, as well as any other standard secure web development practices.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Developed with HTML, Javascript, and CSS. <br>
								<ul>
									<li>Use Bootstrap to develop a clean and function front-end.</li>
									<li>Use PHP and MySQL to interface with the databases.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Responsive Design. <br>
								<ul>
									<li>Mainly focus on designing for computers, tablets, and mobile devices. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
